## 10/23/2025 5 PM - (Nearly) finished making the PCB schematic in KiCad  

I've been following the devboard guide since this is my first time making a hardware project. I just (nearly) finished making the PCB schematic. I've still got a little left from the guide though.

## 10/23/2025 7 PM - Actually finished schematic  

I've finally finished making my schematic for the devboard, thank goodness for these guides. I don't know how I could've done it without them. I've added the crystal, headers, usbc power and flash memory. I also cleaned up the schematic a bit and made it look nicer.![Screenshot 2025-10-23 at 19.17.14.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDY4NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f64cfd15924ef1cc85378ac0252823cd89599aa0/Screenshot%202025-10-23%20at%2019.17.14.png)
