## 10/23/2025 5 PM - (Nearly) finished making the PCB schematic in KiCad  

I've been following the devboard guide since this is my first time making a hardware project. I just (nearly) finished making the PCB schematic. I've still got a little left from the guide though.

## 10/23/2025 7 PM - Actually finished schematic  

I've finally finished making my schematic for the devboard, thank goodness for these guides. I don't know how I could've done it without them. I've added the crystal, headers, usbc power and flash memory. I also cleaned up the schematic a bit and made it look nicer.![Screenshot 2025-10-23 at 19.17.14.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDY4NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f64cfd15924ef1cc85378ac0252823cd89599aa0/Screenshot%202025-10-23%20at%2019.17.14.png)
  

## 10/24/2025 - Routed the PCB  

I've (basically) finished routing the PCB except I haven't finished ironing out all the DRC errors so I'm gonna do that now. It's so interesting to think that I'm done except I still have so many errors to fix (18).

## 10/25/2025 - Actually finished routing the PCB  

I've completely finished all traces on the PCB, with a grand total of 614 track segments and 68 vias. In the last devlog I thought I just had some minor errors to fix up but now I know that I actually have to connect all the +3V3 and +1V1 pads on the RP2040. That was annoying since I hadn't accounted for the extra pads necessary but I made it work.
